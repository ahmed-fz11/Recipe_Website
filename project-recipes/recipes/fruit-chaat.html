    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Fruit chaat, the embodiment of vibrant flavors and textures, is a
      delightful Indian-style medley of fresh fruits. Each mouthwatering bite
      offers a tantalizing combination of sweet, tangy, and spicy notes, as the
      juicy fruits mingle with aromatic spices. The colorful ensemble of apples,
      bananas, oranges, grapes, and pomegranate seeds creates a visually
      appealing feast for the eyes. Sprinkled with a generous dose of chaat
      masala, the chaat dances on the taste buds, awakening them with its zesty
      and tangy essence. A squeeze of lemon juice adds a refreshing twist, while
      the optional drizzle of honey or maple syrup imparts a gentle sweetness.
      Finished with a garnish of fresh mint leaves, the fruit chaat becomes an
      irresistible fusion of flavors, inviting you to savor the delightful
      symphony of tastes in every glorious spoonful.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Assorted fruits of your choice (such as apples, bananas, oranges,
        grapes, pomegranate seeds, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        1 teaspoon chaat masala (a tangy spice blend available in Indian grocery
        stores)
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional)</li>
      <li>Fresh mint leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash and chop the fruits into bite-sized pieces, removing any seeds or
        peels as needed.
      </li>
      <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped fruits.</li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle chaat masala over the fruits, giving them a tangy and flavorful
        kick. Adjust the amount according to your taste preferences.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle lemon juice over the fruits, which adds a refreshing zest.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you prefer a hint of sweetness, add honey or maple syrup and gently
        toss the fruits to coat them evenly. This step is optional, as the
        natural sweetness of the fruits can be sufficient.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the fruit chaat to sit for a few minutes to let the flavors meld
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with fresh mint leaves for a vibrant touch and added fragrance.
      </li>
